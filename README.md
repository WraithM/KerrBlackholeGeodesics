KerrBlackholeGeodesics
======================

Be warned: This code is old and bad. I have not touched it in many years.

This is a collection of simulations of geodesics of a Kerr blackhole. These are visualized (in OpenGL) with a sphere (representing a particle) going around a central sphere (the blackhole).

You can contact me at wraithm `at` gmail `dot` com if you have any questions!


Euler
-----

The code in this section is a little nicer than the other two version, but the simulation is not as rigorous. I use a simple Euler integration. A README is included in this folder.


Lighting
--------

This is a simulation of the geodesics a Kerr Blackhole. I wrote this in C++ with OpenGL and SDL. This version of the code has nice lighting.

This code is set up to work on OS X as it stands.


TwoObjects
----------

This version has two particles. You can compare their orbits.
